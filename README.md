# YearOneMovieList
A full stack application which allows users to search, find information and add reviews for movies.

## How to Get Started 

1.  Requirements (with links to download)
     - Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/,
     - PostgreSQL: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads,
     - Your favorite code editor.  I use Visual Studio Code:  https://code.visualstudio.com/download,
     - You will need an API key to connect to the movie database API I used:  https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative.

2. Database Setup
     - Once PostgreSQL is installed, we need to connect to the database.  This link will give you directions on connecting using psql or pgAdmin:  https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/connecting-postgresql-using-psql-and-pgadmin.
